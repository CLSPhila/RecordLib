"""
Ruledefs are functions that encapsulate legal logic. 

A ruledef takes a criminal record and produces a Decision explaining how a particular rule applies to that criminal record.

These ruledef functions can have a few different signatures. A ruledef might return a PetitionDecision or a regular Decision,
along with the part of a record that didn't match the rule's requirements.
