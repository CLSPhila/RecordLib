Welcome to RecordLib's documentation!
#####################################

RecordLib parses and analyzes criminal records information Pennsylania. It makes some rough guesses about
the charges on a person's record that can be expunged or sealed. And it drafts petitions to expunge or seal
those records. 

The application only *suggests* expungements and *drafts* petitions. 

It is for lawyers who know expungement law really well to skip 
some of the more tedious parts of their practice. **Not for members of the general public**.

The project is also still in development.
