# Large File Storage

These .docx files are stored using git-large-file-storage, or git-lfs.

So before you make any changes to them, make sure you've got git-lfs installed. See https://git-lfs.github.com/.

If you change these without having git-lfs installed, you may cause errors in the repository that will be hard to fix!
