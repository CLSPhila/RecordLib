    We are contacting you because you signed up for help on MyCleanSlatePA.com.  We were able to find cases related to your name and date of birth. 
    This email contains detailed information about your record, and explains how you might be able to clear it.

<p>
    This email is generated by automated screening software. It is not legal advice, and it has not been reviewed by a lawyer. We hope that our automated system helps you 
    find the legal assistance best able to help you.

<p>
    Our automated system used the following information to search for public court records about you:
</p>
${defs.write_search_details()}
<p> 
    The software found ${ len(analysis.record.cases) } cases when searching your information. 
    It appears that ${summary['clearable_charges']} charges, from ${summary['clearable_cases']} cases could be removed from your record by filing a petition
    or through automated sealing, as long as all fines and costs are paid.

% if there_were_traffic_cases:

    <p>
        It looks like there are traffic court cases on your record. This software does not analyze traffic court cases for expungement, 
        so you will need to speak to a lawyer if you would like to clear any traffic court cases.
    </p>

% if len(analysis.remaining_record.cases) != 0:
<p>
    It looks like you may need a pardon to clear parts of your record. See the end of the email for information about
    getting legal help to clear your remaining record.
